# **Quire Notepad.**
This is an editable notepad that a collective of students at KYH Nacka Sweden created for a team project.<br>
We had an assignment to create a functional notepad that could store unique notes in the local storage. So let's talk about this notepads functions.

### Quill Editor.

We didn't build the text editor from the ground up. Instead, we got the editor from Quill (special thanks to them). <br>
Quill comes with cool functions already added. Like changing font, size, adding videos or pictures etc. These will serve you well when you use it.

### Our functions.
* First time you visit our page, you are greeted with an information page that describes what you can do with our text editor. This will not show up the second time you visit.
* Store your notes with our save function. It will store everything you write and place it in our "My Notes" section. There you can easily click on it to bring forward your notes.
* Every time you save a note, it will add a timestamp so you know how long ago you worked on your note.
* We have three different buttons called F1, F2, and F3 that adds our own special unique font to your notes. See if you like them. The button FN takes you back to the original font.
* The button "New Page" empties your note and you can start with a whole new page.
* Every note that you save will come with a star and an trash can image. Clicking on the trash can will delete it forever. Clicking on the star image will add the note into the favorite section. 
Clicking on the bigger star in our nav section will bring forward all of your favorites notes.
